				A few of my strengths would be my ability to be seen as a leader by others
				despite not seeing in myself.
				It all began from when I was in primary school.I was always the monitor and finally in 
				grade 6 I had been appointed prefect, monitor and head boy of my year group.
				<br>The other one would also being able to be calm in situations where others
				tend to let emotions lead them.
				<br>The last I would say is my ability to stay focused on a specific task, my friends
				say at times I am a bit too focused often time neglecting my bodily needs
				such as sleep and hunger to get said tasks done.
				<br>I have been come a long way in these aspects and I am currently improving
				not exactly where I wanna be but small progress is still progress.

					<u><h2>Twelve Pillars</h2></u>

				&emsp;
				Chapter 4 of the book Twelve Pillars is about achieving your goals. I’ve always heard from persons that writing your goals down helps you to actually visualize them and kind of tricks your brain into doing them because you are looking at something tangible, and it reminds me of the quote “The pen is mightier than the sword” by English author Edward Bulwer-Lytton.
				&emsp;<br>Chapter 5 is about the proper use of one’s time. There is a specific line from the book that kind of ties it together “We must all suffer from one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons”. This is saying that you should try your best to not procrastinate because at the end of the day that is one less day and it’s gone and can never be regained, so spend your time wisely doing the important and less on the urgent, either time controls you or you control your time.
				&emsp;<br>Chapter 6 is about surrounding yourself with the best people. “Who am I around? What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself the big question: Is that okay?”. From the extract it is clear what is coming across here, the people you surround yourself with influence your attitude and how you view aspects of your life. So you should try your best to surround yourself with persons that stir your curiosity and push you to be more successful and set even bigger goals.
				&emsp;<br>Chapter 7 is about being a life-long learner. “Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. Most people don’t continue to learn or grow, so the very fact that you are doing so means you are well
				&emsp;<br>on your way to improving your life.” This chapter speaks about learning and how being a lifelong learner will benefit you in becoming better and more successful. Reading and observing successful persons’ habits and how you can apply them to your own life, not only that but reflect on your own experiences and learn what went right and what went left and maybe in the end you can help others by sharing what you’ve learned.
				&emsp;<br>The main thing I’ve learned from these few chapter is how I can change my attitude and those I surround myself with and not keep my mind closed and be willing to learn because knowledge is power and that power will help you influence others around you for the better.
